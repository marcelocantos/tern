# Convergence Targets

## Active

### 🎯T1 Tern is a complete library for opaque authenticated relay

All crypto, protocol state machines, code generators, QR helper, and
Swift package live here. Applications import tern rather than duplicating
relay/pairing logic.

- **Weight**: 1.7 (value 5 / cost 3)

**Sub-targets:**

#### 🎯T1.8 Jevon imports tern's packages

Jevon's `internal/crypto/`, `internal/protocol/`, `internal/qr/`, and
`cmd/protogen/` are replaced by imports from tern. iOS app imports
the `Tern` SPM package.

- **Weight**: 1.7 (value 5 / cost 3)
- **Status**: not started (requires tern to be tagged and pushed)

### 🎯T5 Multi-transport with LAN upgrade

Devices connected through the relay can discover they're on the same
LAN and upgrade to a direct connection. The `tern.Conn` abstraction
hides this — callers see a single ordered message stream regardless
of transport.

- **Weight**: 0.8 (value 5 / cost 6)

#### 🎯T5.1 Reorder-tolerant decryption

`Channel.Decrypt` buffers out-of-order sequence numbers instead of
rejecting them. Required for safe transport cutover.

- **Weight**: 1.7 (value 5 / cost 3)
- **Status**: not started

#### 🎯T5.2 LAN discovery via relay

After the encrypted channel is established, both sides exchange their
local IP addresses through the relay. Each attempts a direct WebTransport
connection to the peer's local address using a self-signed certificate.

- **Weight**: 1.0 (value 5 / cost 5)
- **Status**: not started
- **Depends on**: 🎯T5.1

#### 🎯T5.3 Cutover protocol

Each side sends a `CUTOVER` marker as its final message on the old
transport, then sends subsequent messages on the new transport. The
receiver reads from both transports, orders by sequence number, and
closes the old transport after receiving `CUTOVER`.

- **Weight**: 1.0 (value 5 / cost 5)
- **Status**: not started
- **Depends on**: 🎯T5.1, 🎯T10

#### 🎯T5.4 Transport-agnostic Conn

`tern.Conn` manages multiple underlying transports. Sends go on the
preferred transport; receives come from any transport and are delivered
in sequence order. Upgrading and downgrading are transparent to the
caller.

- **Weight**: 0.8 (value 5 / cost 6)
- **Status**: not started
- **Depends on**: 🎯T5.2, 🎯T5.3

### 🎯T6 Investigate STUN/NAT hole-punching as a transport

STUN-based peer-to-peer connectivity as a middle tier between relay
and LAN direct. Uses a STUN server to discover public IP/port
mappings, then both peers attempt UDP hole-punching to establish a
direct path without relaying traffic.

Sits between relay and LAN in the transport priority:
1. LAN (same network)
2. STUN/P2P (different networks, direct via hole-punch)
3. Relay (always works, fallback)

Same cutover protocol as 🎯T5.3 applies — it's just another transport.

Needs investigation:
- STUN server requirements (run our own, or use public ones?)
- UDP vs TCP hole-punching (tern already uses QUIC/UDP via WebTransport)
- Success rate across NAT types (symmetric NATs defeat STUN)
- Whether to use ICE (the full WebRTC negotiation framework) or a
  simpler STUN-only approach
- TURN as the fallback when hole-punching fails (essentially our
  existing relay, but standard protocol)
- Go and Swift STUN/ICE libraries (pion/ice, libnice)

- **Weight**: 1.5 (value 3 / cost 2)
- **Status**: not started

### 🎯T7 Investigate Bluetooth as proximity oracle

Bluetooth as a proximity signal rather than a data channel. Possible
uses:

- **Pairing trust signal**: if both devices see each other over
  Bluetooth during the pairing ceremony, they're physically co-located.
  Could supplement or replace the 6-digit confirmation code.
- **Transport upgrade hint**: Bluetooth discovery indicates the
  devices are nearby, making LAN direct connection likely to succeed.
- **Proximity-gated handover**: only attempt LAN upgrade when
  Bluetooth confirms proximity, avoiding wasted connection attempts.

Needs investigation: BLE advertising APIs on iOS/Android, power and
battery implications, interaction with existing pairing ceremony,
privacy considerations (Bluetooth MAC address rotation).

- **Weight**: 1.0 (value 2 / cost 2)
- **Status**: not started

### 🎯T8 WebTransport relay

WebTransport (QUIC) is the sole transport for the relay path. Enables
both reliable streams (control, pairing) and unreliable datagrams
(H.264 video, real-time data). WebSocket support has been removed.

- **Weight**: 1.0 (value 5 / cost 5)

#### 🎯T8.4 Web/TypeScript WebTransport client

Browser-native WebTransport API in `web/`. Use reliable stream for
control/pairing, datagrams for video.

- **Weight**: 1.0 (value 5 / cost 5)
- **Status**: not started

#### 🎯T8.5 LAN direct WebTransport with cert fingerprint

Ephemeral self-signed cert for LAN listener. Include SHA-256 hash in
the LAN offer control message. Browser peers use
`serverCertificateHashes` to accept it (Chromium-only for now; others
fall back to relay-only).

- **Weight**: 1.0 (value 3 / cost 3)
- **Status**: not started
- **Depends on**: 🎯T8.4

### 🎯T10 TLA+ model for cutover protocol

Model the transport cutover protocol in TLA+ to verify liveness and
correctness properties:
- No message lost during cutover
- No message duplicated
- No message delivered out of order
- No deadlock (both sides eventually complete the transition)
- Concurrent cutover initiation from both sides is safe

The E2E encryption provides security (verified by the existing pairing
ceremony TLA+ spec). This model focuses on the transport switching
logic: CUTOVER markers, reorder buffer, and the transition from relay
to LAN transport.

### 🎯T14 Browser WebTransport E2E

Prove the browser WebTransport path works end-to-end.

Playwright headless Chromium does NOT support WebTransport/QUIC —
tested against both tern.fly.dev and Google's webtransport.day echo
server; both fail with ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR. The Go WebTransport
client connects to the same server successfully, confirming the server
is correct.

Options:
1. Use Playwright with `headless: false` (headed Chrome) — requires
   a display (CI won't work without Xvfb)
2. Use Selenium + headless Chrome (webtransport-go's own tests do this)
3. Manual verification with a real browser

Server config verified correct: EnableDatagrams on both http3.Server
and quic.Config. Let's Encrypt cert persisted and valid.

- **Weight**: 1.0 (value 3 / cost 3)
- **Status**: blocked on Playwright headless Chromium QUIC support

---

### 🎯T15 Gomobile bindings for iOS and Android

Wrap the Go QUIC client via gomobile to give native iOS and Android
apps the same proven QUIC stack. Replaces the need for platform-specific
QUIC libraries (Network.framework quirks, kwik builder bugs).

Produces:
- iOS: XCFramework importable from Swift
- Android: AAR importable from Kotlin

- **Weight**: 1.0 (value 5 / cost 5)
- **Status**: not started

### 🎯T16 Fly.io auto-start for UDP

The Fly.io machine stops when idle and doesn't auto-start for UDP
traffic. Every test session requires manual `fly machines start`.
Investigate:
- Keep-alive mechanism (periodic health ping from a cron job)
- Fly's `auto_start_machines` with a TCP health check on a separate port
- Alternative hosting that handles UDP auto-start natively

- **Weight**: 1.7 (value 5 / cost 3)
- **Status**: done — TCP service on port 443 with auto_start_machines=true.
  Fly proxy wakes the machine on TCP/HTTPS, then UDP flows to the running
  machine. WakeRelay() helper for clients.

### 🎯T18 State machine mediates all Conn behavior

The session state machine is the sole mediator between the application
layer (Send, Recv, OpenChannel, Close) and the I/O layer (socket
read/write, connection error, timeout, datagram arrival). Application
calls become events into the machine; I/O completions become events
into the machine; the machine emits I/O commands. No ad-hoc Go logic
decides when to switch paths, restart dispatchers, drain queues, or
retry reads — the machine's transition table defines all of that.

**Current state**: The generated `BackendMachine`/`ClientMachine`
model protocol state transitions (LAN offer → verify → active →
degrade → fallback → backoff → re-offer). But Conn still has ad-hoc
Go code for I/O lifecycle: `Recv` decides to retry on a dead stream,
`OnChange` handlers infer dispatcher restarts from variable changes,
goroutines independently manage health monitoring. The machine
declares what state the system should be in; the executor guesses
how to get there.

**Desired state**: The machine framework supports two event surfaces:
- **Top (application)**: `app_send`, `app_recv`, `app_open_channel`,
  `app_close` — caller intent
- **Bottom (I/O)**: `relay_bytes_received`, `lan_bytes_received`,
  `lan_connection_error`, `ping_timeout`, `datagram_arrived` — I/O
  completions

The machine's transition table maps (state × event) → (new state ×
actions × I/O commands). The executor is a thin event loop: wait for
events from either surface, feed to machine, execute commands. All
resource lifecycle (dispatcher binding, stream reader binding, queue
draining, monitor start/stop) is expressed as states and transitions,
not executor-side inference.

**Implications**:
- The YAML spec gains I/O event types and I/O command types alongside
  the existing message types
- The code generator emits a richer machine with command output, not
  just state + variable updates
- `Conn` becomes a thin wrapper: event loop + registered I/O
  handlers, no protocol logic
- Goroutines exist only for blocking I/O (socket reads), not for
  state management decisions
- TLA+ verification covers the full behavior, not just the protocol
  subset

**Forked from**: attempt to wire generated machines into Conn
(stashed as `git stash` on master). The wiring attempt revealed that
variable-change callbacks (`OnChange`) are the wrong abstraction —
the machine should drive behavior through transitions, not variable
diffs. The stash contains two independently useful changes that
should be cherry-picked:
1. `Step(event EventID)` — fixes unreachable cases in generated
   `Step()` when multiple internal transitions share the same From
   state. Includes `EventID` type, generated event constants, and
   updated generic `Machine.Step`.
2. `protogen --root-pkg=tern` — generates session_gen.go into the
   tern package (avoiding redeclaration conflicts with the legacy
   pairingceremony_gen.go in protocol/).

### 🎯T17 Makefile deploy target

`make deploy` that deploys to Fly.io, starts the machine, and waits
for it to be healthy. `make e2e-live` should depend on this so live
tests work without manual machine management.
