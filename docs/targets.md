# Convergence Targets

## Active

### 🎯T1 Pigeon is a complete library for opaque authenticated relay

All crypto, protocol state machines, code generators, QR helper, and
Swift package live here. Applications import pigeon rather than duplicating
relay/pairing logic.

- **Weight**: 1.7 (value 5 / cost 3)

**Sub-targets:**

#### 🎯T1.8 Jevon imports pigeon's packages

Jevon's `internal/crypto/`, `internal/protocol/`, `internal/qr/`, and
`cmd/protogen/` are replaced by imports from pigeon. iOS app imports
the `Pigeon` SPM package.

- **Weight**: 1.7 (value 5 / cost 3)
- **Status**: not started (requires pigeon to be tagged and pushed)

### 🎯T5 Multi-transport with LAN upgrade

Devices connected through the relay can discover they're on the same
LAN and upgrade to a direct connection. The `pigeon.Conn` abstraction
hides this — callers see a single ordered message stream regardless
of transport.

- **Weight**: 0.8 (value 5 / cost 6)

#### 🎯T5.2 LAN discovery via relay

After the encrypted channel is established, both sides exchange their
local IP addresses through the relay. Each attempts a direct WebTransport
connection to the peer's local address using a self-signed certificate.

- **Weight**: 1.0 (value 5 / cost 5)
- **Status**: not started

#### 🎯T5.3 Cutover protocol

Each side sends a `CUTOVER` marker as its final message on the old
transport, then sends subsequent messages on the new transport. The
receiver reads from both transports, orders by sequence number, and
closes the old transport after receiving `CUTOVER`.

- **Weight**: 1.0 (value 5 / cost 5)
- **Status**: not started
- **Depends on**: 🎯T10

#### 🎯T5.4 Transport-agnostic Conn

`pigeon.Conn` manages multiple underlying transports. Sends go on the
preferred transport; receives come from any transport and are delivered
in sequence order. Upgrading and downgrading are transparent to the
caller.

- **Weight**: 0.8 (value 5 / cost 6)
- **Status**: not started
- **Depends on**: 🎯T5.2, 🎯T5.3

### 🎯T6 Investigate STUN/NAT hole-punching as a transport

STUN-based peer-to-peer connectivity as a middle tier between relay
and LAN direct. Uses a STUN server to discover public IP/port
mappings, then both peers attempt UDP hole-punching to establish a
direct path without relaying traffic.

Sits between relay and LAN in the transport priority:
1. LAN (same network)
2. STUN/P2P (different networks, direct via hole-punch)
3. Relay (always works, fallback)

Same cutover protocol as 🎯T5.3 applies — it's just another transport.

Needs investigation:
- STUN server requirements (run our own, or use public ones?)
- UDP vs TCP hole-punching (pigeon already uses QUIC/UDP via WebTransport)
- Success rate across NAT types (symmetric NATs defeat STUN)
- Whether to use ICE (the full WebRTC negotiation framework) or a
  simpler STUN-only approach
- TURN as the fallback when hole-punching fails (essentially our
  existing relay, but standard protocol)
- Go and Swift STUN/ICE libraries (pion/ice, libnice)

- **Weight**: 1.5 (value 3 / cost 2)
- **Status**: not started

### 🎯T7 Investigate Bluetooth as proximity oracle

Bluetooth as a proximity signal rather than a data channel. Possible
uses:

- **Pairing trust signal**: if both devices see each other over
  Bluetooth during the pairing ceremony, they're physically co-located.
  Could supplement or replace the 6-digit confirmation code.
- **Transport upgrade hint**: Bluetooth discovery indicates the
  devices are nearby, making LAN direct connection likely to succeed.
- **Proximity-gated handover**: only attempt LAN upgrade when
  Bluetooth confirms proximity, avoiding wasted connection attempts.

Needs investigation: BLE advertising APIs on iOS/Android, power and
battery implications, interaction with existing pairing ceremony,
privacy considerations (Bluetooth MAC address rotation).

- **Weight**: 1.0 (value 2 / cost 2)
- **Status**: not started

---

### 🎯T8 WebTransport relay

WebTransport (QUIC) is the sole transport for the relay path. Enables
both reliable streams (control, pairing) and unreliable datagrams
(H.264 video, real-time data). WebSocket support has been removed.

- **Weight**: 1.0 (value 5 / cost 5)

#### 🎯T8.4 Web/TypeScript WebTransport client

Browser-native WebTransport API in `web/`. Use reliable stream for
control/pairing, datagrams for video.

- **Weight**: 1.0 (value 5 / cost 5)
- **Status**: not started

#### 🎯T8.5 LAN direct WebTransport with cert fingerprint

Ephemeral self-signed cert for LAN listener. Include SHA-256 hash in
the LAN offer control message. Browser peers use
`serverCertificateHashes` to accept it (Chromium-only for now; others
fall back to relay-only).

- **Weight**: 1.0 (value 3 / cost 3)
- **Status**: not started
- **Depends on**: 🎯T8.4

---

### 🎯T10 TLA+ model for cutover protocol

Model the transport cutover protocol in TLA+ to verify liveness and
correctness properties:
- No message lost during cutover
- No message duplicated
- No message delivered out of order
- No deadlock (both sides eventually complete the transition)
- Concurrent cutover initiation from both sides is safe

The E2E encryption provides security (verified by the existing pairing
ceremony TLA+ spec). This model focuses on the transport switching
logic: CUTOVER markers, reorder buffer, and the transition from relay
to LAN transport.

- **Weight**: 0.6 (value 3 / cost 5)
- **Status**: not started

### 🎯T14 Browser WebTransport E2E

Prove the browser WebTransport path works end-to-end.

Playwright headless Chromium does NOT support WebTransport/QUIC —
tested against both carrier-pigeon.fly.dev and Google's webtransport.day echo
server; both fail with ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR. The Go WebTransport
client connects to the same server successfully, confirming the server
is correct.

Options:
1. Use Playwright with `headless: false` (headed Chrome) — requires
   a display (CI won't work without Xvfb)
2. Use Selenium + headless Chrome (webtransport-go's own tests do this)
3. Manual verification with a real browser

Server config verified correct: EnableDatagrams on both http3.Server
and quic.Config. Let's Encrypt cert persisted and valid.

- **Weight**: 1.0 (value 3 / cost 3)
- **Status**: blocked on Playwright headless Chromium QUIC support

---

### 🎯T15 Gomobile bindings for iOS and Android

Wrap the Go QUIC client via gomobile to give native iOS and Android
apps the same proven QUIC stack. Replaces the need for platform-specific
QUIC libraries (Network.framework quirks, kwik builder bugs).

Produces:
- iOS: XCFramework importable from Swift
- Android: AAR importable from Kotlin

- **Weight**: 1.0 (value 5 / cost 5)
- **Status**: not started

---

### 🎯T17 Makefile deploy target

`make deploy` that deploys to Fly.io, starts the machine, and waits
for it to be healthy. `make e2e-live` should depend on this so live
tests work without manual machine management.

- **Weight**: 1.5 (value 3 / cost 2)
- **Status**: not started

---

### 🎯T20 Cross-language E2E test parity

Every language that has a generated state machine and client library
has automated E2E tests that connect to a real Go relay, exercise the
full pairing ceremony (ECDH + confirmation code), and exchange
encrypted messages. Tests run in CI without manual intervention.

- **Weight**: 2.5 (value 5 / cost 2)
- **Status**: not started

#### 🎯T20.1 Swift E2E integrated into `swift test`

The standalone E2E binary (`e2e/swift/main.swift`) works but is not
run by `swift test`. Integrate it as an XCTest target that starts a
Go relay subprocess and exercises register, connect, stream round-trip,
encrypted round-trip, and confirmation code verification.

- **Weight**: 2.5 (value 5 / cost 2)
- **Status**: not started (standalone binary exists, needs test target integration)

#### 🎯T20.2 State machine unit tests for Swift/Kotlin/TypeScript

The generated `handleEvent` machines are only tested implicitly through
relay E2E tests. Each language should have explicit unit tests that
verify: state transitions for the transport phase (relay → LAN offered
→ LAN active → degraded → fallback → backoff → re-establish), correct
command emission per transition, and guard evaluation.

- **Weight**: 1.7 (value 5 / cost 3)
- **Status**: not started

#### 🎯T20.3 Cross-language confirmation code interop test

A Go backend and each non-Go client (Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript) perform
a full ECDH key exchange through a live relay and independently derive
the 6-digit confirmation code. The test asserts both sides compute the
same code. Currently each language hardcodes "629624" in unit tests but
no test verifies agreement through an actual relay.

- **Weight**: 2.5 (value 5 / cost 2)
- **Status**: not started
- **Depends on**: 🎯T20.1 (Swift), 🎯T20.2 implicitly

#### 🎯T20.4 TypeScript local E2E tests

TypeScript tests currently only run against a live relay (requiring
PIGEON_TOKEN). Add local E2E tests that start a Go relay subprocess
(like Kotlin does) so they run in CI without credentials.

- **Weight**: 2.0 (value 4 / cost 2)
- **Status**: not started
