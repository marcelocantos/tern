# Convergence Report

Evaluated: 2026-04-07

## Standing invariants

- **Tests**: PASSING (CI tests job succeeded on master)
- **CI**: PARTIAL — tests green, **deploy failing** (Fly.io `FLY_API_TOKEN` unauthorized since rename to carrier-pigeon). Not a code issue — needs token rotation in GitHub secrets.

## Movement

- 🎯T20: (new) — added with sub-targets T20.1-T20.4
- 🎯T1, 🎯T1.8, 🎯T5, 🎯T6, 🎯T7, 🎯T8, 🎯T10, 🎯T14, 🎯T15, 🎯T17: (unchanged)

## Gap Report

### 🎯T20 Cross-language E2E test parity  [weight: 2.5]
Gap: not started
Parent target. 0/4 sub-targets achieved. Swift standalone E2E binary exists but is not in `swift test`. Kotlin has local E2E tests (PigeonConnE2ETest starts relay subprocess). TypeScript E2E requires live relay + PIGEON_TOKEN. No state machine unit tests in any non-Go language.

  [ ] 🎯T20.1 Swift E2E integrated into `swift test` — not started: standalone `e2e/swift/main.swift` exists, Package.swift has `PigeonTests` target but no relay E2E test target
  [ ] 🎯T20.2 State machine unit tests for Swift/Kotlin/TypeScript — not started
  [ ] 🎯T20.3 Cross-language confirmation code interop test — not started (blocked on 🎯T20.1, 🎯T20.2)
  [ ] 🎯T20.4 TypeScript local E2E tests — not started: `relay.e2e.ts` exists but requires PIGEON_TOKEN, no local relay subprocess

### 🎯T1.8 Jevon imports pigeon's packages  [weight: 1.7]
Gap: not started
v0.14.0 released. Migration in jevon repo still pending — requires updating jevon's imports to pigeon packages.

### 🎯T6 Investigate STUN/NAT hole-punching  [weight: 1.5]
Gap: not started
Pure research target. No code or investigation artifacts exist yet.

### 🎯T17 Makefile deploy target  [weight: 1.5]
Gap: not started
No Makefile deploy target exists. Note: deploy is currently broken (Fly.io auth) — fixing that is a prerequisite.

### 🎯T1 Pigeon is a complete library  [weight: 1.7]
Gap: converging (7/8 sub-targets achieved)

  [x] 🎯T1.1 Crypto library — achieved
  [x] 🎯T1.2 Pairing protocol spec — achieved
  [x] 🎯T1.3 TLA+ formal model — achieved
  [x] 🎯T1.4 Protocol state machine framework — achieved
  [x] 🎯T1.5 QR helper — achieved
  [x] 🎯T1.6 Swift package — achieved
  [x] 🎯T1.7 E2E integration test — achieved
  [ ] 🎯T1.8 Jevon imports pigeon's packages — not started

### 🎯T8 WebTransport relay  [weight: 1.0]
Gap: converging (3/5 sub-targets achieved)

  [x] 🎯T8.1 WebTransport relay server — achieved
  [x] 🎯T8.2 Non-strict Channel.Decrypt — achieved
  [x] 🎯T8.3 Go WebTransport client — achieved
  [ ] 🎯T8.4 Web/TypeScript WebTransport client — not started
  [ ] 🎯T8.5 LAN direct WebTransport — not started (blocked on 🎯T8.4)

### 🎯T14 Browser WebTransport E2E  [weight: 1.0]  (status only)
Status: blocked on Playwright headless Chromium QUIC support

### 🎯T15 Gomobile bindings  [weight: 1.0]  (status only)
Status: not started

### 🎯T7 Investigate Bluetooth as proximity oracle  [weight: 1.0]  (status only)
Status: not started

### 🎯T5 Multi-transport with LAN upgrade  [weight: 0.8]
Gap: converging (1/4 sub-targets achieved)

  [x] 🎯T5.1 Reorder-tolerant decryption — achieved
  [ ] 🎯T5.2 LAN discovery via relay — not started
  [ ] 🎯T5.3 Cutover protocol — not started (blocked on 🎯T10)
  [ ] 🎯T5.4 Transport-agnostic Conn — not started (blocked on 🎯T5.2, 🎯T5.3)

### 🎯T10 TLA+ model for cutover protocol  [weight: 0.6]  (status only)
Status: not started. Low effective weight — blocks 🎯T5.3 but expensive relative to value.

### Blocked targets

- 🎯T20.3 Cross-language confirmation code interop test — blocked on 🎯T20.1, 🎯T20.2
- 🎯T5.3 Cutover protocol — blocked on 🎯T10
- 🎯T5.4 Transport-agnostic Conn — blocked on 🎯T5.2, 🎯T5.3
- 🎯T8.5 LAN direct WebTransport — blocked on 🎯T8.4

## Recommendation

Work on: **🎯T20.1 Swift E2E integrated into `swift test`**
Reason: Highest effective weight (2.5) among unblocked leaf targets. The standalone E2E binary (`e2e/swift/main.swift`) already proves the Swift QUIC path works — this is packaging it as an XCTest target that starts a Go relay subprocess. Low cost, high value, and unblocks 🎯T20.3 (cross-language confirmation code interop).

## Suggested action

Add a new test target in `Package.swift` (e.g., `PigeonRelayE2ETests`) that depends on `Pigeon`. Create a test file that starts a Go relay subprocess (`go run ./cmd/pigeon`), runs the register/connect/stream/crypto round-trip tests from `e2e/swift/main.swift`, and tears down the subprocess. Use `Process` to manage the relay lifecycle. Use `/push` to drive the PR workflow.
