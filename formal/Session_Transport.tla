Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_vars /\ WF_vars(Next)

\* ================================================================
\* Invariants and properties
\* ================================================================

\* Paths are always valid
PathConsistency == b_active_path \in {"relay", "lan"} /\ c_active_path \in {"relay", "lan"}
\* Backoff never exceeds cap
BackoffBounded == backoff_level <= max_backoff_level
\* LAN success resets backoff
BackoffResetsOnSuccess == backend_state = backend_LANActive => backoff_level = 0
\* Dispatchers always bound to valid path
DispatcherAlwaysBound == b_dispatcher_path \in {"relay", "lan"} /\ c_dispatcher_path \in {"relay", "lan"}
\* Backend dispatcher on LAN when LAN active
BackendDispatcherMatchesActive == backend_state = backend_LANActive => b_dispatcher_path = "lan"
\* Client dispatcher on LAN when LAN active
ClientDispatcherMatchesActive == client_state = client_LANActive => c_dispatcher_path = "lan"
\* Monitor only pings when LAN is active/degraded
MonitorOnlyWhenLAN == monitor_target = "lan" => backend_state \in {backend_LANActive, backend_LANDegraded}
\* After fallback, backend eventually re-advertises LAN
FallbackLeadsToReadvertise == (backend_state = backend_RelayBackoff) ~> (backend_state = backend_LANOffered)
\* Degraded state eventually resolves (recovery or fallback)
DegradedLeadsToResolutionOrFallback == (backend_state = backend_LANDegraded) ~> (backend_state \in {backend_LANActive, backend_RelayBackoff})

\* ================================================================
\* Command-consistency: state after transition matches emitted commands
\* These are verified by construction (the same YAML defines both
\* the variable updates and the command list), but documenting
\* them as TLA+ operators makes the relationship explicit.
