Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_vars /\ WF_vars(Next)

\* ================================================================
\* Invariants and properties
\* ================================================================

\* A revoked pairing token is never accepted again
NoTokenReuse == used_tokens \intersect active_tokens = {}
\* MitM produces mismatched codes
MitMDetectedByCodeMismatch == (backend_shared_key \in adversary_keys /\ backend_code /= <<"none">> /\ client_code /= <<"none">>) => backend_code /= client_code
\* Compromised key prevents pairing completion
MitMPrevented == backend_shared_key \in adversary_keys => backend_state \notin {backend_StorePaired, backend_Paired, backend_AuthCheck, backend_SessionActive}
\* Session requires completed pairing
AuthRequiresCompletedPairing == backend_state = backend_SessionActive => received_device_id \in paired_devices
\* Each auth nonce accepted at most once
NoNonceReuse == backend_state = backend_SessionActive => received_auth_nonce \notin (auth_nonces_used \ {received_auth_nonce})
\* Adversary never learns device secret
DeviceSecretSecrecy == \A m \in adversary_knowledge : "type" \in DOMAIN m => m.type /= "plaintext_secret"
\* Paths are always valid
PathConsistency == b_active_path \in {"relay", "lan"} /\ c_active_path \in {"relay", "lan"}
\* Backoff never exceeds cap
BackoffBounded == backoff_level <= max_backoff_level
\* LAN success resets backoff
BackoffResetsOnSuccess == backend_state = backend_LANActive => backoff_level = 0
\* Dispatchers always bound to valid path
DispatcherAlwaysBound == b_dispatcher_path \in {"relay", "lan"} /\ c_dispatcher_path \in {"relay", "lan"}
\* Backend dispatcher on LAN when LAN active
BackendDispatcherMatchesActive == backend_state = backend_LANActive => b_dispatcher_path = "lan"
\* Client dispatcher on LAN when LAN active
ClientDispatcherMatchesActive == client_state = client_LANActive => c_dispatcher_path = "lan"
\* Monitor only pings when LAN is active/degraded
MonitorOnlyWhenLAN == monitor_target = "lan" => backend_state \in {backend_LANActive, backend_LANDegraded}
\* After fallback, backend eventually re-advertises LAN
FallbackLeadsToReadvertise == (backend_state = backend_RelayBackoff) ~> (backend_state = backend_LANOffered)
\* Degraded state eventually resolves (recovery or fallback)
DegradedLeadsToResolutionOrFallback == (backend_state = backend_LANDegraded) ~> (backend_state \in {backend_LANActive, backend_RelayBackoff})

\* ================================================================
\* Command-consistency: state after transition matches emitted commands
\* These are verified by construction (the same YAML defines both
\* the variable updates and the command list), but documenting
\* them as TLA+ operators makes the relationship explicit.
